## 📋 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: 22.18.0 or higher (see `.nvmrc` file)
- **pnpm**: 10.18.0 or higher (see `package.json` engines)
- **PostgreSQL**: 14.0 or higher
- **Git**: Latest version

### Version Management
This project uses strict version requirements to ensure consistency across development environments:

- **Node.js**: Use the version specified in `.nvmrc` (22.18.0)
- **pnpm**: Use the version specified in `package.json` engines (10.18.0+)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm is required (npm/yarn are not supported)

#### Quick Setup with nvm (Node Version Manager)
```bash
# Install and use the correct Node.js version
nvm install
nvm use

# Verify versions
node --version  # Should show v22.18.0
pnpm --version  # Should show 10.18.0+
```

#### Version Enforcement
This project uses `engines-strict: true` in `package.json` to enforce version requirements. This means:
- pnpm will refuse to install dependencies if Node.js or pnpm versions don't meet requirements
- CI/CD pipelines will fail if incorrect versions are used
- Developers will get clear error messages about version mismatches

### Development Infrastructure (Docker Compose)
For local development, you can use Docker Compose to run the required services:

```bash
# Start all development services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dep.yaml up -d

# View running services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dep.yaml ps

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.dep.yaml logs -f

# Stop all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dep.yaml down

# Stop and remove volumes (WARNING: This will delete all data)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dep.yaml down -v
```

#### Services Included
- **PostgreSQL 14**: Database server with health checks
- **Redis 7**: Caching and session storage
- **MinIO**: Object storage for file uploads
- **Network**: Isolated bridge network for service communication
